                <div class="articletitle">2019 Meal Cold Weather Menu 6, Seafood Chowder</div>
                <p>The Meal Cold Weather, or MCW, is the US's answer to an Arctic ration, designed to be used in cold climates it has a freeze dried main meal so that your food doesn't freeze, as well as a number of high calorie snacks to provide extra energy in the cold environment. The MCW is much like an MRE - designed to essentially just be a cold climate MRE, with 3 issued per day.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The MCW generally doesn't have any spreads as in an MRE due to the chance of them freezing, so components are usually meant to be eaten alone or with the main meal. For example in this ration, the crackers are meant to be paired with the main. Dehydration is a real risk in Arctic environments due to the extra exertion associated with being in the cold, so the MCW contains a lot of drinks to encourage soldiers to keep hydrated, but it does make this ration incredibly water demanding. Due to the freeze dried mains, the ration is also very light.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The MCW comes in 12 menus, with this being one of nine meain meals. Each main meal calls for 16oz of water to rehydrate. These numbers are a little over what is needed, so generally you should add a little less water than called for to avoid your meal becoming "soupy". I tend to opt for 14 ounces.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This meal is another in the MCW lineup I've been quite excited to try - as of the new 2022 menus this main is discountinued, and Mountain House have stopped producing them comerically, so it's nice to be able to try this menu before the non freeze dried components in it get too old.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This particular menu seems to not have that many items, but when rehydrated, you are left with an immense amount of food that would probably be enough for the entire day for a civillian. Seafood chowder is an interesting choice for a military ration, however eating it on a cold day, it was absolutely perfect.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The contents of this ration were:</p>
                <p>Freeze Dried Seafood Chowder, Chicken Ramen Noodle Soup, Vegetable Crackers, A Maple Pound Cake, Tropical Punch Beverage Base and a spoon. The ration also came with a standard MCW accessory pack - Coffee, Creamer, Sugar, Gum, Hot Sauce and Toilet Paper</p>

                <div class="articletitle">Seafood Chowder</div>
                <p>Now, while its called a 'seafood chowder' in reality, it's a clam chowder with a few shrimp in it, which is no bad thing. I rehydrated this main with 14 of the called for 16oz of water, which was a good call as the chowder ended up nice and thick and not too soupy.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The chowder had a creamy, fishy smell with a herby undertone, quite a pleasant smell. The main element of the chowder was the clams, they were in decently sized chunks and had a bit of a chewy texture similar to say mackerel. The chowder had a creamy sauce seasoned with dill, which went perfectly with the fish, it also had a slight oniony flavour which was nice. Accompanying the clams was also some cubed potatoes and celery, the potatoes weren't mushy and still had some bite, tasted like potatoes. Tthe celery on the other hand was amazing, it was still a bit crispy / crunchy due to the freeze drying process so added in some much needed texture, definitely elevated the meal.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The chowder was not just clams though - it also had shrimp, or was supposed to. I only found two in the entire portion (which was pretty big) and they were absolutely tiny, somewhat disappointing given Mountain House's reputation for making high quality meals. The shrimp I did find, tasted great and really quite fresh, they also had a bite just like perfectly cooked shrimp. I just wish they were bigger and there was more of them.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Once I'd eaten most of the chowder and was left with mostly the cream sauce, I decided to break up the vegetable crackers and put them in the chowder to soak up the sauce. I tried the crackers on their own first, they have a light wheaty flavour with backdrops of peppers and onion, really they're great, especially with some cheese spread. Spooning chowder on the cracker and eating it like that isn't the best, letting them soak up the sauce then eating them is a lot more enjoyable and tasty, however the chowder doesn't need anything adding to it and was perfectly enjoyable on its own.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The chowder on its own was incredibly filling, so I only got through one cracker with it, that was enough for me for the entire day - these MCW mains are incredibly filling normally and this one especially so. All in all, I really enjoyed this meal, its warmth enjoyed on a cold rainy day really heals part of the soul.</p>

                <div class="articletitle">Ramen Noodles and Marble Pound Cake</div>
                <p>Because of how large the main was, I waited a couple days to enjoy the other components, like I said it was an absolutely massive portion and filled me up for the entire day. Next up was the chicken ramen cup noodles, or 'Soup, Noodles, Ramen, Instant Chicken Flavour'.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The ramen package very handily has a fill line on it and calls for 8oz of water, half that of the main meal, what I like to do is open the package and then fold it in half at the fill line so you get a crease inside the pack to see where you need to add water to. After adding the water I waited about 10 minutes and poured the noodles out into a bowl.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The ramen was certainly an interesting experience, I had a hard time actually discerning a flavour when I first tasted the broth, it was salty and there was a vague chicken-y flavour in the broth but it didn't exactly taste like chicken either, quite unlike anythng I've had before. The noodles themselves are really quite nice and resemble that of a pot noodle. The veggies were the highlight of the ramen for me, since they were freeze dried they held their texture, taste and shape, they were awesome.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The ramen when you slurp the noodles with the broth tastes way better, and I think adding just a little less water to the noodles would make the broth thicker and the noodles even more enjoyable. When you eat them together you're given a warm, satisfying and extremely filling bowl of noodles, nice and salty, the ramen was very enjoyable.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As for the marble pound cake, it had a soft, moist exterior that was a little crumbly but not too dry. Biting into it felt like biting into a block of creamed butter and sugar, it was quite grainy but still soft and cakey. This wasn't too unexpected as the cake was nearly 1/3 sugar. The cake was quite nice, mostly a standard vanilla cake with a nice flavour that isn't too strong of vanilla, it had a nice chocolatey swirl throughout. The chocolate cake in it didn't have too pronounced of a flavour but it was definitely there, overall a little stale taste but it just tasted like a really dry marble cake, it was good.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I decided not to review the tropical punch beverage base - it isn't easy to photograph and honestly the beverage bases you get in US rations aren't that good at all. Overall I extremely enjoyed this ration, it was very filling and quite delicious.</p>
