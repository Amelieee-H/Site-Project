                <p>The Food Packet, Long Range Patrol or LRP was a ration used by the US from 1964 until around 2016, until it was fully merged with the Meal, Cold Weather (MCW). The purpose of the LRP is to have a calorie dense, lightweight ration for use on long missions by special forces where weight needs to be reduced as much as possible. This particular ration is from the 1998 production run, one of the only mass production runs of this ration in the 1990s, with most, if not all, of the '98 LRPs being packed in December 1998. This ration came in 8 menus, all of which were traditional meals, unlike more modern LRPs which had breakfast menus. The LRP was designed to be an extremely limited calorie 24 hour ration for long range missions, for use up to 10 days at one ration per man, per day. However, if the mission allows up to 3 LRPs can be issued per man per day, for a total of 4500 calories a day.</p>

                <p>This review is probably going to be a little biased, as this is probably my personal favourite ration of all time, but I haven't had one for about three years - I've been waiting for a special occasion to break into my little stockpile of these 98 lasagnas :). Unfortunately it seems like this ration was exposed to quite a lot of heat in the hands of it's previous owner, as when it got to me the plastic was already delaminating. This ration was opened by customs but they didn't take anything - the damage is unlikely to have gotten this bad just during shipping either.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Unfortunately, due to the severity of the heat damage and delamination, I don't think any of the components apart from the lasagna are going to be save to eat, so I am only going to review the lasagna. The lasagna itself also had quite a lot of heat damage and delamination, with a hole being made and breaking the vacuum seal when I was unfolding the flaps to photograph it. Luckily since the lasagna itself is freeze dried and up until that point, vacuum sealed, the heat damage didn't impact it too much.</p>

                <div class="articletitle">Opening and Rehydrating the Lasagna</div>
                <p>The first image is of the Lasagna outer packaging flattened out after having the meal brick removed, as you can see it is a tan military style packaging, the inside is metal lined and the packaging is vacuum sealed around the meal and is very 'crinkly' looking due to this. A few important things to note include the ingredients of the meal, the USDA approved stamp, the weight of the meal which is 150 grams and the producer, Oregon Freeze Dry (more commonly known as mountain house). You'll also see on the bottom right of the package, REV.8-98, this means that the recipe was revised in August 1998, meaning the meal must be produced after then - which we know is true since the 1998 LRPs were all packed in December of 98.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>After opening the tan outer packaging, I could smell the freeze dried tomatoes, other than that not much smell, as to be expected from a freeze dried main. With these 1998 LRP mains, they are meant to be double bagged so that you are able to decant some of the freeze dried food and split the main into two if desired, interestingly this one wasn't double bagged. As always, the meal bag had an oily exterior, seems to be common with these 1998 LRPs, I think it's the plastic used.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After unsticking the inner meal bag and opening it up, I loosened up the meal components from the brick and josteled them around a bit to ensure they weren't stuck, after that I added the full amount of required water and stirred gently before twisting the bag shut and holding the top closed with the included paper ring/bag bottom (see gallery for this article). Generally, with freeze dried meals its a good idea not to add all the water incase the meal becomes soupy, but the lasagna chugs water, and I'd even be tempted to add extra as this ended up quite thick!</p>
                <br>
                <p>After adding the water and stirring I was immediately hit with an intense beefy, tomatoey smell with hints of herbs and a little cheese. I'm at a loss for words how to describe it other than that, it smelled so incredibly delicious that I'm getting hungry thinking about it while writing this 6 months later...</p>

                <div class="articletitle">Taste Testing the Lasagna</div>
                <p>So, onto the actual taste test. The overall flavour is of an amazingly rich tomatoe-y sauce, perfectly seasoned with herbs and little pockets of cheesy meat sauce, it's honestly amazing. The pasta still has some bite to it, not chewy or mushy, just right. The beef is a little chewy, as to be expected from any freeze dried meal, but still tastes amazing. Dotted in with the pasta and meat sauce are little chunks of freeze dried tomatoes, these retained their juciness and a little of their natural bite, I found they added quite a nice texture and flavour variance to the meal. Similarly, little slices of onion retained their texture and crisp, equally great! I can't really find more words to describe the lasagna, its perfect, meaty, cheesy ration goodness. It's tasty, it's filling, it tastes just like any decent lasagna would. I cannot fault it in any way, it's amazing. Little hints of garlic, onion, parsley and parmesan cheese really add to the complexity of the meat sauce flavour. This particular main has three types of cheese - mozzerella, parmesan and romano, and you can definitely tell it, apart from there being a general hint of cheesiness to the sauce, you'll actually find little chunks of goey melted cheese in the sauce, the middle image below shows one of these little orange chunks of goodness. </p>
                <br>
                <P>The consistency of the lasagna is pretty thick, as I said earlier, it's a thirsty meal. While it doesn't exactly resemble a traditional lasagna in looks, flavour wise, everything is there and its really a satisfying meal to eat. If you wanted to make it less thick and a little more resemblant of a thick stew or some sort of lasagna soup, adding extra water would be the way to go - I've done this in the past, and it's definitely a good way to stretch the meal more as well as make it a bit more filling. It's also a bit easier to see the cheese chunks if you add extra water. I made it using exactly the called for amount of water, so it ended up pretty thick, if I were to have it again (and I will) I'm going to add just a little more water than this time, it's tasty thick but making it thinner offers a more pleasant eating experience in my opinion. Overall, I cannot fault the lasagna main, or this LRP menu, in any way, I definitely would've loved a "dessert" item like a chocolate covered cookie, and maybe a pack of cocoa instead of tea, but those are just my personal preferences. 10/10</P>
                <br>
                <p>Splitting this LRP into 3 meals to make it last one day, as you would do in a limited resupply situation, would be relatively easy in my opinion - make a cereal with the bran flakes bar and creamer, having it alongside the peanut butter and crackers. Then spread the lasagna main out half and half for lunch and dinner - I believe doing this was the idea behind the typical double bagging of these RCW/LRP mains (though it should be noted the lasagna was never in the Ration Cold Weather lineup). The bran flakes bar is an interesting one, while many think or assume it came in the Food Packet Survival, General Purpose, it didn't, it only ever came in 3 of the 8 menus for the 1998 LRP, making it one of the rarer US ration items! Sadly since the heat damage was so severe on this ration, I decided to forgoe trying it.</p>
