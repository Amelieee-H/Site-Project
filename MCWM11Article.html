                <div class="articletitle">2019 Meal Cold Weather, Menu 11, Western Style Scrambled Eggs</div>
                <p>The Meal Cold Weather, or MCW, is the US's answer to an Arctic ration, designed to be used in cold climates it has a freeze dried main meal so that your food doesn't freeze, as well as a number of high calorie snacks to provide extra energy in the cold environment. The MCW is much like an MRE - designed to essentially just be a cold climate MRE, with 3 issued per day.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The MCW generally doesn't have any spreads as in an MRE due to the chance of them freezing, so components are usually meant to be eaten alone or with the main meal. Dehydration is a real risk in Arctic environments due to the extra exertion associated with being in the cold, so the MCW contains a lot of drinks to encourage soldiers to keep hydrated, but it does make this ration incredibly water demanding. Due to the freeze dried mains, the ration is also very light, with this particular menu weighing 488 grams.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The MCW comes in 12 menus, with three of these being breakfast menus of freeze dried eggs, all the other menus are interchangeable lunch and dinner menus. Each breakfast main calls for 8oz of water to rehydrate, and the non-breakfast meals require 16oz of water to rehdrate. These numbers are a little over what is needed, so generally you should add a little less water than called for to avoid your meal becoming "soupy". </p>
                <br>
                <p>I have wanted to try the MCW eggs for a few years now, I've always found it incredibly interesting that you can freeze dry eggs so well, and that they made it into a military ration as a breakfast meal, so I am very excited to review this ration. The MCW menus with eggs are highly sought after so it's taken me a while to get one here in the UK but I have to say it was definitely worth the wait.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This particular menu felt very 'unhealthy' to me, I mean cake and a milkshake for breakfast?! It was delicious though.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The contents of this ration were:</p>
                <p>Freeze Dried Western Scrambled Eggs, Freeze Dried Granola w/ Milk and Blueberries, Maple Muffin Top (Trans Fat Free), Cheddar Cheese Pretzels, Frosted Brown Sugar Cinnamon Toaster Pastry, Chocolate Hazelnut Beverage Powder and an Orange Beverage Base. The ration also came with a standard MCW accessory pack - Coffee, Creamer, Sugar, Gum, Hot Sauce and Toilet Paper</p>

                <div class="articletitle">Western Style Scrambled Eggs and the Maple Muffin Top</div>
                <p>The first component of this ration I ate was the maple muffin top (trans fat free) while I was waiting for the eggs to rehydrate. The muffin top had a moist and sticky exterior with a really strong maple scent. It had a cakey and fluffy texture similar to some pre-packaged shelf stable pancakes you can get at the store in the bakery section. It tastes somewhat like one of these pancakes too, tasing more pancakey than of maple, of which the maple flavour was more in the background and made the muffin top taste like pancakes and syrup, it was incredibly delicious. Though the muffin top was a little dry inside, it wasn't thrist provoking and held its shape well, not creating many crumbs.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The eggs I rehydrated with 6 ounces of water instead of the called for 8, to try and avoid my eggs becoming soupy, however sadly it seems that even 6oz was too much water. The eggs took about 10 minutes to rehydrate and had a strong smokey bacon scent that was coming off the "ham" (I am calling it bacon).</p>
                <br>
                <p>The eggs were really nice, with some tasting just of egg and others having a really cheesy flavour, they held their shape really well and had a texture like that of regular scrambled eggs. Though some of the smaller bits of egg were a little grainy/gritty, from where in the packing process some eggs became a bit crushed and turned into dust, but this wasn't unpleasant. The bacon was incredibly good, it was fatty and chewy like regular bacon, though some bits were a bit too chewy for my liking, it had a nice smokey flavour. The peppers were for me, the highlight of this main, they had an amazing fresh pepper flavour and due to the freeze drying process still had crunch to them, this added some texture variation as well as a pop of colour. The peppers mixed wonderfully with the eggs and bacon, making this seem like a homecooked breakfast burrito filling, it tasted amazing and was overall a top notch meal.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My only complaint for the eggs is the egg dust created a sort of gritty "soup" at the bottom of the pouch/plate due to the excess water, it didn't take away from the meal but wasn't ideal. I would suggest only adding half of the water called for and then adding more if necessary.</p>

                <div class="articletitle">Brown Sugar Toaster Pastry and the Cheddar Cheese Pretzels</div>
                <p>The 'Frosted Brown Sugar Cinnamon Toaster Pastry' - or pop tart, is a component that is usually looked forward to but unfortunately in my case it was not an enjoyable component. This might possibly be due to its age - it was produced in mid 2019 and I ate it in mid 2024, 5 years after it was produced.</p>
                </br>
                <p>The pop art had an aroma similar to a pet store and reminded me of hamster and bird food, something I really wasn't expecting. Taste wise the pop tart was a little bland, with little initial taste apart from a crumbly crackery/shortbread flavour paired with a faint hint of cinnamon, though it had a more enjoyable aftertaste after chewing of thick brown sugar and caramel which was quite nice. It was incredibly dry and crumbly, and had a cakey bite similar to that of a soft cracker. It was an alright dessert item but would've definitely benefitted from being fresher - I recently had another pop tart in a US ration that was less than two years old and extremely delicious so I am putting this one down to age.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Next up, 'Cheddar Cheese Pretzels' or how those in the US may know, 'combos'. The pretzels had a dry, dusty and hard exterior, biting into them they are very crunchy and even drier, incredibly thirst provoking. The pretzels are coated in a lightly spiced coating and do taste of pretzels, though the spice overpowers the pretzel flavour a bit, in the centre you will find incredibly fake processed cheddar that is a nice contrast of moisture, and tastes of a fake shelf stable cheddar though it isn't unpleasant at all. There was not nearly enough cheese in these, mix with the dry pretzel and the spice dust, these were an ok snack but incredibly thirst provoking.</p>
