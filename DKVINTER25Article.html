                <div class="articletitle">2022 Danish Winter Ration, Menu 25 - Beef Stroganoff, Chicken Curry and Porridge</div>
                <p>The Danish "VINTER" Winter ration, is certainly a rare treat, it is one of the three main types of ration produced by Denmark for their troops. These three types being, FRYS (freeze dried mains), WET (retort pouch mains) and VINTER. This is by far the biggest and the rarest of those three, the winter ration packs an extra 600+ calories when compared to a standard Danish FRYS ration, they contain an extra freeze dried meal for a total of three, instead of relying on snacks for one of the meals like in a standard Danish ration, as well as numerous other extra components.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It's been about six years at the time of writing (March 2025) since I last saw one of these for sale, so I picked up a few for my collection - seemingly good timing, as of late 2024/ early 2025, Denmark is supposedly swapping the main supplier for its meals from Orifo to Rationtech.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The main freeze dried meals in this menu were; Porridge, Beef Stroganoff and Chicken Curry w/ Rice</p>
                <br>
                <p>The other components in this ration were; Bisca Grovkiks (3x), Wholewheat Bread, Chocolate Cake, Dark Chocolate, Fruit Puree, BBQ Peanuts, Raspberry Jam, Strawberry Jam, Hazelnut Spread W/ Cocoa, Caramel Cereal Bar, Choco-Orange Cereal Bar, Honey BBQ Beef Jerky (2x), Beef Soup (2x), Spicy Sauce (2x), Hot Chocolate (2x), Lemon Beverage Base, Raspberry Beverage Base, Raisins, Dried Cranberries, Breakfast Tea (3x), Freeze Dried Coffee (3x)</p>
                <br>
                <p>Also included, were the following sundries; Wet Wipe (3x), Toothpick (3x), Salt (3x), Pepper (3x), Chewing Gum (3x), Sugar (2x), Spoon (3x), Toothbrush, Rubber Bands (2x), Recloseable Plastic Bag (2x).</p>

                <div class="articletitle">Lunch: Chicken Curry And Rice, Cocoa and Jerky</div>
                <p>I decided to opt for the chicken curry for lunch in this ration, to me the stroganoff seems more like a dinner meal than curry. I also had the cocoa drinking powder and some of the honey BBQ beef jerky with lunch, it's hard to take pictures of the drinks so I'll only be describing it.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The chicken curry had quite a heavy smell of coriander, turmeric and curry powder, honestly reminded me of a curry pot noodle that we get here in England. The curry was really tasty, a generic yellow curry flavour with a non offensive light sauce made from primarily chicken stock, as opposed to the traditional onions, nicely spiced but not spicy in any way, very generic flavour and clearly not trying to imitate any specific curry, it's just a rather generic curry, with no real spice or sauce. The rice was very soft and flavourful, dotted with small chunks of carrot and parsley leaves, which really add to the meal in my opinion. There are generous and large chunks of chicken, a little chewy because they're freeze dried but enjoyable nonetheless, nice curry flavour to them as well. This meal was really enjoyable, however it lacked "sauce" in the traditional sense you'd expect in a curry, so I might be tempted to add extra water than is asked for to the main to make it a bit saucier. In retrospect I think it would've been a good idea to use the spicy sauce on the curry, as I felt it really lacked any spice or "oomph" and is in danger of being almost bland. Overall, really quite an enjoyable meal I'd happily eat again, but it needs spice!</p>
                <br>
                <p>The cocoa drink, enjoyable but not mind blowing in my opinion. It calls to be made in 150ml of water, leaving you with a really strong and sugary hot chocolate, but not one that's creamy, essentially the same as making any civvie hot chocolate but double strength. A really heavy deep chocolatey taste that sticks to your mouth. These cocoa drinks are the same ones found in Dutch rations. Overall, it was ok, but not as life changing as some other reviewers seem to think. I had two packs, so I mixed one with some freshly warmed full fat Jersey milk, now that was divine! I think the cocoa really suffers from having to be mixed in water in a ration situation, if you get one, use milk, not water, night and day difference.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The jerky, honey BBQ beef, was one of the components I was most excited for, being a big fan of the Wild West jerky anyway, I knew I'd like it. Nice beefy flavour, chewy bits of jerky that arent too hard, with a nice background flavour of barbecue smokiness and honey, super enjoyable. No complaints other than you get skimped on the amount in a package, but that's the same in the packs you buy at the store, which is I suppose why you are given two packs in the winter rations, as opposed to one in a standard Danish ration.</p>
