    <div class="header">About me</div>
    <div class="centered">Hi, my name is Ameli√©, I'm a student from the UK studying Software Engineering and learning Swedish in my free time.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="centered">This is a website I have made to showcase my collection of various military rations and related objects. This has been my hobby since I was quite young and I'm quite passionate about military rations, with my primary interest initially being on British rations from the 1990s with a general interest in all rations. </div>
    <br>
    <div class="centered">I hope by creating this website I can not only share my hobby with people, but also provide some valuable information as well as preserve it for history, as much of what I've learned does not seem to be documented. By making this website I can also save my experiences eating and unboxing various rations, which hopefully you will find interesting. Rations are special as they can give an insight into what daily life was like for soldiers, an exact experience that they will have had while serving. I'll be looking at rations both old and new, with the oldest ration I've eaten being from 1970 - 51 years old at the time!</div>
    <br>
    <div class="centered">I'm also using this building website as a way to teach myself web development such as HTML, CSS and Javascript, so you'll have to forgive me if it is basic, though I think for the type of website this is, simple is best. So far I have been finding this extremely fun and I look forward to being able to share my experiences and collection with you.</div>
