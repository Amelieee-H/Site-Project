                <div class="articletitle">2024 Outmeals Artic Ration, Menu 6</div>
                <p>This ration is one I have been looking forward to trying for a while, it is an Arctic ration produced by Outmeals who make meals for the Swedish Army, this one being menu 6 produced in 2024. It is an extremely efficient ration in regards to weight and calories, weighing just 918 grams and containing just shy of 4000 calories. Being designed to be used in cold weather conditions, this ration has three freeze dried main meals and a variety of snacks that aren't prone to freezing.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Initially I thought these rations were civillian, and this seems to be true, while outmeals does make these exact same rations for the Swedish Army, it should be noted that those ones produced for the Swedish army contain an army identification number above the calorie information at the top of the ration. This code of 'M0827-706010' shows that it is an official product produced for the Swedish army as this is an army stock code. This ration is nearly identical to the one produced for the army, the rations for the army contain an extra hard candy, extra whey powder and a fruit bar as well as an extra main meal, usually oatmeal or museli. This is to supplement the calories to bring it up to what is needed in the Arctic - with each military version having about 4700 calories. </p>
                <br>
                <p>The meals in this menu were; Tropical Muesli, Macaroni Pomorodo and Goulash Stew. These meals are quite large, with the main ones, produced by Bl√• Band, taking nearly half a litre of water to reconstitute.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The other components in the ration were; Nut cream, rosemary crackers, cheese oat biscuits, banana chips, salted cashew nuts, chocolate whey powder, salted caramel energy bar, coconut protein bar, apple isotonic drink, peach isotonic drink, hard candy, chewing gum (3x), wet wipe (3x), coffee (3x), spoon, napkins and 3 toothpicks.</p>

                <div class="articletitle">Lunch: Macaroni and Salted Caramel Bar</div>
                <p>I decided to opt for a lighter lunch when eating this ration because of the large size of the freeze dried mains, and I'm glad I did as the main was extremely filling. I had the macaroni pomorodo as well as the salted caramel protein bar.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The macaroni took 500ml of water and about 15 minutes to rehydrate, leaving me with a rather large portion of food. The macaroni itself was cooked very well, but wasnt mushy and still had some texture to it, making it easy to spear with a fork. The sauce had an amazing tomato and onion flavour, with some traditional pasta sauce seasonings such as oregano. I didn't realise this before I had rehydrated the meal but it actually came with a sort of vegetarian minced meat alternative made from soy and pea protein, this gave the meal some extra texture and flavour, with the "meat" itself being extremely delicious and seasoned well with a little spice, though it was not spicy. The addition of the vegetarian mince took the meal to another level, the added textures and flavours made it much more hearty and filling. Overall I found the macaroni really enjoyable, even if it was quite oily which makes it seem shiny in the pictures. I would happily eat it again.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The main fit perfectly in the lid container of the Swedish M/44 mess kit, I imagine by design, making eating an easy experience, though in the field you would be more likely to eat the main out of its pouch, the built in gusset helps to keep the pouch upright on its own and rounded edges inside the pouch ensure that you won't have any dry bits stuck in corners. For the purpose of this review I decided to eat it in the mess kit, interestingly this ration does not come with a spoon but the normal rations from Outmeals with retort pouches do, so I used a Swedish army issued cutlery set to eat it. </p>
                <br>
                <p>The salted caramel protein bar was incredibly delicious, the caramel flavour was amazing and incredibly strong, though it wasnt too sweet, having just a hint of saltiness. The bar was topped with oats that added some much needed texture to the otherwise very chewy and malleable bar, but they also added a nice oaty neutral balance to the bar. The dark chocolate in the bar was more of a background flavour but a welcome one. So far this is probably one of my favourite parts of the ration, it was amazing.</p>
