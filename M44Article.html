                <div class="articletitle">Swedish M44 Mess Kit</div>
                <p>In this article we take a look at an item from my own collection, a 1971 Swedish Army M/44 mess kit, my personal favourite mess set for a number of reasons, the main of which being its functionality.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The M/44 (or "Model Of 1944") kit actually starts life in 1940, where the M/40 kit, nearly identical to this one, is adopted by the Swedish Army. The M/40 kit made from stainless steel, and as such is rather resource intensive to make, just four years later the M/44 was introduced. The M/44 is made from aluminum, and as such is significantly cheaper and easier to produce, this was largely due to resource shortages brought about by the second world war, with Sweden exporting much of its iron and steel to both the allies and the axis.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The M/44 kit itself is made up of two main pot elements - a pot with a bale hook and a lid with a handle (I like to call it a frying pan, as that is one of its many uses). The kit also comes with an innovative windshield, which I will talk about later, that doubles as the basis for the stove kit.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The main cooking pot is relatively simple, with a bale handle with attached hook. The main pot also has a notch for the handle on the lid to tuck into when the kit is packed away - the idea is that a leather strap would go around this while the windshield was on to help keep the kit together. This strap hole also allowed for the mess kit to be carried on the M/1937 backpack. </p>
                <br>
                <p>The strap hole also serves a secondary purpose, the bale handle has two notches for the inbuilt hook -  one directly vertical to allow for hanging over a fire, and one at around 2 o'clock, the secondary notch allows for the hook to bend down and tuck into the strap hole. This creates a study handle for the main cooking pot that is easy to grab, does not fall into the fire, and stays cool.</p>

                <div class="articletitle">Makeup Of The Mess Kit (cont)</div>
                <p>The lid, or frying pan, is also simple but incredibly functional. It is a simple lid that fits over the main cooking pot to close it off, but it also fits ontop of the cooking pot thanks to its smaller, tapered base. This allows for a double-boiler to be created to help warm food, this is incredibly useful if you are using the kit to cook a meal as opposed to warming rations, as you can boil water for pasta in the main pot while frying off meat or cooking a sauce in the frying pan.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The lid has a folding handle, which slots over the strap hole on the main pot when the kit is packed away. This handle has two folding D rings, the purpose for these is to hold a stick, the rings are then clamped down on the stick and a longer more robust handle has been created. This feature is intended to mitigate the fact the lids handle is made of aluminum, so any direct use would result in the handle getting extremely hot making it unsuitable for direct use. The lid can either be used directly as a frying pan in a fire or on a stove, ontop of the cooking pot, or as a simple lid for the cooking pot.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The next element of the mess kit I would like to look at is the windshield, a critical element without which use of the stove would be extremely difficult. The windshield is a solid metal construction that is also stamped with the relevant 3 crown marking, it is perfectly shaped to accomodate the M/44 kit. The base of the windshield is flat, with a round cut-out for placing the alcohol stove into, the base also contains the two folding handles. When unfolded these silver handles lock into place and act as a base for which the kit can sit ontop of.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The raised handles allow for appropriate distance between the stove and pot, but also allow for the lid pan to be used directly on the stove, fitting it perfectly in a widened area to ensure that it cannot fall down. The handles when folded away are not noticeable, and the kit has been designed to accomdate them. The windshield also has several cutouts raised along its base by about an inch to allow for proper airflow to the stove. The windshield is a simple piece of metal - but in my opinion it is one of the reasons this kit is the best around, it allows for the kit to be used standalone as a cooking instrument with ease.</p>

                <div class="articletitle">The Stove & Cooking</div>
                <p>The stove the kit comes with is commonly nicknamed the Trangia stove, since they produced most of them, and have a near identical civillian model. The military stove that comes with the M/44 is a larger stove than with civillian kits and has an internal reservoir for alcohol fuel. The stove is brassy/gold in colour and used with Spirit 35 - known more commonly as methylated spirits. The stove itself is extremely simple - it has a screw cap with a rubber seal and is stamped with 3 crowns on the base, lit with matches or a lighter. </p>
                <br>
                <p>It should be noted that the flames from the spirit 35 are mostly invisible during the day, so when lighting it is best to hold your hand well above the flame to check if the stove is properly lit. The lid is used to extinguish the stove, simply by dropping the lid ontop of the stove to snuff out the flame. This poses no danger to the stove or seal. However, the lid should not be screwed back onto the stove when either it or the lid is still warm, as this will lead the lid to crack as the metal cools and shrinks.</p>

                <div class="articletitle">Production Of The Mess Kit</div>
                <p>The M44 kit is produced for various Swedish agencies, namely the Ministry of Defence and, in the past, the Swedish homeguard. The models produced for the Swedish army can be identified by a three crown swamp on the front of the main cooking pot and on the smaller frying pan, these are generally the most desired and are pretty much guaranteed to be genuine examples as products with the three crown stamp are regulated for military use.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Models produced for the Swedish homeguard have a homeguard logo branded into them, the homeguard shield with a large 'X' going through it, these kits seem to be a little more uncommon, which is understandable as the Swedish homeguard is a relatively small organisation and would likely have been equipped with surplus Army mess kits that already had the three crown stamps</p>
                <br>
                <p>There are also numerous examples of different companies producing M40/44 kits, for example 'ESSKILUNA PRESSBOLAGET' kits forgo the 3 crown stamp and instead stamp a four leaf clover. This seems to be more common with the M/40 kits. Though, as I said, there were numerous producers of the M/40 and M/44 kits, such as Gense and ones like my example stamped 'NC' - other earlier sets simply had a producer number stamped in.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The stove for the kit was made by private contractors, usually referred to as just the 'Trangia' stove as Trangia make a similar model, and produced a large amount of M40/44 kit stoves, though SVEA was also contracted to make the stoves and the pots for the M40/44 kits in the same design, again with the three crown stamp.</p>
